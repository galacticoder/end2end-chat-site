# **AUTOMATIC TOR SETUP** - Zero Configuration Required!

Your SecureChat application now includes **fully automatic Tor setup**! No manual configuration needed.

## **What Happens Automatically:**

### **One-Click Setup Process:**
1. **Auto-Detection**: Checks if Tor is already installed
2. **Smart Download**: Downloads the correct Tor version for your OS
3. **Auto-Install**: Installs Tor in a secure application directory
4. **Optimal Config**: Creates the best configuration automatically
5. **Auto-Start**: Launches Tor service and verifies connection
6. **Ready to Use**: Your app is now routing through Tor!

### **‚è±Ô∏è Setup Time: 30-60 seconds**
- **Download**: ~15 seconds (depends on internet speed)
- **Installation**: ~10 seconds
- **Configuration**: ~5 seconds
- **Connection**: ~15 seconds

## üéØ **How to Use:**

### **First Time Setup:**
1. **Launch SecureChat** - The app will detect you don't have Tor
2. **Click "Auto-Setup Tor Network"** - One button does everything
3. **Wait for completion** - Progress bar shows real-time status
4. **Start chatting anonymously** - Tor indicator shows you're protected

### **That's it!** No terminal commands, no configuration files, no technical knowledge required.

## üõ°Ô∏è **What You Get:**

### **üîí Automatic Security Features:**
- **IP Address Hidden**: Your real IP is completely masked
- **Location Privacy**: Geographic location becomes untraceable
- **ISP Blindness**: Your internet provider can't see your activity
- **Government Resistance**: Bypasses censorship and surveillance
- **Circuit Rotation**: Automatically changes routes every 10 minutes
- **Connection Monitoring**: Real-time status and statistics

### **üìä Visual Indicators:**
- **üü¢ Green "Tor" Badge**: Shows when you're protected
- **üìà Connection Stats**: Circuit count, data transferred, rotation times
- **‚ö° Circuit Rotation**: Manual and automatic circuit switching
- **üîÑ Status Updates**: Real-time connection monitoring

## üéõÔ∏è **Advanced Options (Optional):**

### **If You Want Manual Control:**
- **Stop/Start Tor**: Control the service manually
- **View Configuration**: See current Tor settings
- **Uninstall**: Remove Tor if no longer needed
- **Custom Settings**: Advanced users can modify configuration

### **Bridge Support (For Censored Networks):**
The auto-setup can enable Tor bridges for countries that block Tor:
- Automatically detects if bridges are needed
- Downloads and configures obfs4 bridges
- Works in China, Iran, and other restrictive countries

## üö® **Troubleshooting (Rare Issues):**

### **If Auto-Setup Fails:**
1. **Check Internet**: Ensure you have a stable connection
2. **Antivirus**: Some antivirus software blocks Tor downloads
3. **Firewall**: Windows Firewall might need permission
4. **Admin Rights**: Some systems require administrator privileges

### **Manual Fallback:**
If automatic setup fails, the app provides:
- **Clear error messages** explaining what went wrong
- **Manual setup instructions** for your specific issue
- **Alternative download links** if primary sources are blocked
- **Support information** for getting help

## Security Features

### Circuit Rotation
- Automatically rotates Tor circuits every 10 minutes
- Manual circuit rotation available via the Tor indicator
- Enhances anonymity by changing exit nodes

### Connection Monitoring
- Real-time connection status
- Circuit count and rotation tracking
- Data transmission statistics
- Connection attempt monitoring

### Fallback Behavior
- If Tor connection fails, the application can fallback to direct connections
- User is notified of connection status changes
- Automatic reconnection attempts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Failed to connect to Tor network"
- Ensure Tor is running: `sudo systemctl status tor`
- Check if port 9050 is available: `netstat -an | grep 9050`
- Verify Tor configuration in `/etc/tor/torrc`

#### 2. "Connection timeout"
- Tor might be starting up (can take 30-60 seconds)
- Check firewall settings
- Verify network connectivity

#### 3. "Circuit rotation failed"
- Ensure control port (9051) is accessible
- Check CookieAuthentication settings
- Verify control port permissions

### Logs and Debugging

#### Check Tor logs:
```bash
# Linux/macOS
sudo journalctl -u tor

# Or check log file
tail -f /var/log/tor/tor.log
```

#### Application logs:
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Check console for `[TOR]` prefixed messages
- Monitor network requests for Tor connectivity tests

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Tor Bridges (for censored networks)
Add to `torrc`:
```
UseBridges 1
Bridge obfs4 [bridge-address]
```

### Hidden Service Setup (optional)
To run your chat server as a hidden service:
```
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/chat_service/
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:3000
```

### Performance Tuning
```
# Faster circuit building
CircuitBuildTimeout 10
LearnCircuitBuildTimeout 1

# More circuits
NumEntryGuards 8
```

## Security Considerations

1. **DNS Leaks**: The application routes all traffic through Tor, preventing DNS leaks
2. **WebRTC**: P2P connections may bypass Tor - use with caution
3. **JavaScript**: All network requests are routed through Tor proxy
4. **Metadata**: Tor hides your IP but message timing analysis may still be possible
5. **Exit Node Trust**: Your traffic exits through Tor exit nodes - use HTTPS

## Testing Tor Connection

You can verify your Tor connection by:

1. Checking the Tor indicator in the application (green = connected)
2. Visiting https://check.torproject.org/ in your browser
3. Monitoring the application logs for successful Tor initialization

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review application logs in browser developer tools
3. Verify Tor service is running and configured correctly
4. Test Tor connectivity with other applications (like Tor Browser)

Remember: Tor provides network-level anonymity but doesn't replace the need for end-to-end encryption, which this application already provides through Signal Protocol and post-quantum cryptography.
